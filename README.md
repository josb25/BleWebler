# BleWebler
BleWebler (BLE Web Labeler) is a lightweight, browser-based label printing tool that connects to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) thermal printers â€“ no drivers, no apps, no vendor lock-in. It runs entirely in Chromium-based browsers and communicates directly with supported devices using the Web Bluetooth API.
